# ACESS 15-Day Learning Challenge

## Today, I started the **15-Day Backend Masterclass Challenge**


## Day 1: Database Design  

Focused on database design:  

- Designed a **Database Schema** using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io).  
- Created a structured **schema table** for a banking application backend.

---

## Day 2: Setup Local enviroment

 - Set up Docker and created a local development environment using PostgreSQL and SQLC Go.
 - Learned the basics of Docker, including commands to view images, containers, and logs.

---

## Day 3: Database Migration and Makefile Setup  
Today, I focused on improving the project structure and database management:  

- **Learned About:**  
  - Setting up database migrations using the `migrate` tool in Go.  
  - Creating a `Makefile` to streamline local development tasks and commands.  

- **Key Takeaway:**  
  Database migrations are essential for maintaining a consistent database schema throughout the development lifecycle. Using a `Makefile` simplifies repetitive tasks and improves project maintainability.

## Day 4: Generating Go Code with SQLC  
The focus of today was on bridging SQL and Go seamlessly:  

- **Learned About:**  
  - Using **SQLC** to automatically generate Go code for SQL queries.  
  - Building a type-safe and efficient database interaction layer for the backend application.  

- **Key Takeaway:**  
  SQLC automates query-to-code generation, reducing errors and saving development time. It ensures consistency between the database and the application code, enhancing reliability.
